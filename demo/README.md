# streamlines-demo

This is just a demo for the streamline generation library. It is nice to quickly experiment
with the library, but I encourage you to try the library independently to get its full potential.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8890
npm start
```
